    <h1>Your Child Is Not Our Priority</h1>
</body>
<p>
    I am sorry that your child is not our priority. I don't work for your child, nor for you. I work for my principal, who in turn works for the school board. You see, no one in the whole system works for you, nor your child. 
</p>
<p>
    But we have to lie to you because if we tell you the truth, our contract won't be renewed for the next school year. It is not that easy to find a teaching job. And most of us don't really know how to work in the real world. 
</p>
<p>
    Maybe there are some teachers who truly care about your child. But they won't last long. They will get frustrated because they can not really help your child. They will either get in trouble with their colleagues or their principal. And if they are good teachers, they can find other jobs with more money and less stress.
