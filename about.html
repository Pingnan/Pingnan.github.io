    Hi, I am Dr. Ping. I retired from engineering in 2011 before I became a high school math teacher at a private Christian college prep school. That is where I realized why many American children are traumatized by math. So I decided to start my own teaching and tutoring ministry to help my students study math and appreciate its beauty and power. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt in love with math when I was about 14 years old living in a company town in South Western China. A colleague of my dad showed me how to solve algbra problems that were presented as puzzels. I was hooked and spent a lot of time studying math on my own. Soon I went to college when I was only 15 years old. 
  </p>
  <p>My math skills helped me won a scholorship to pursuie graduate studies in Canada. In 1995, I moved to Indianapolis to work as an senior engineer. Before I retired from engineering, I was granted 15 US patents.</p>
  <p>In a way, math helped me escape from communist China and became an American citizen. It also helped me see the awesome power of a Creator and escape from Atheism to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>
